# Logistic Regression Model Analysis

## Introduction

This document provides an analysis of the Logistic Regression model used in this project. We detail the effects of hyperparameter tuning, specifically the learning rate (`LR`) and regularization strength (`lambda`), on model performance.

## Hyperparameters in Focus

- **Learning Rate (LR):** Controls the step size during the iterative optimization process.
- **Regularization (Lambda):** Applies a penalty to increasing model complexity to prevent overfitting.

## Model Performance Observations

### Accuracy Improvement
Increasing the learning rate results in improved accuracy metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

This suggests that larger updates to the model weights help the model to converge faster to a robust set of parameters.

### Error Rate Volatility
A higher learning rate introduces greater fluctuations in error rates, indicating a trade-off between faster convergence and stability of the learning process.

### Confusion Matrix Analysis
With an increased learning rate, the model shows a higher number of correctly classified instances, as indicated by the values in the confusion matrix.

### ROC Curve and AUC
The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the Area Under Curve (AUC) metrics show improvement with a higher learning rate, indicating better model discrimination capability.

## Conclusion

The analysis indicates that while a higher learning rate can improve overall model performance, it also increases the variability of error rates. It is essential to find a balance between learning rate and regularization to ensure the model is not only accurate but also generalizable to new data.
